Magenta is an open-source research project exploring how AI can generate music and art. It provides pre-trained models and tools like MusicVAE and MelodyRNN for generating melodies, harmonizing tunes, and more. Magenta is built on TensorFlow and includes a large collection of MIDI datasets for training custom models.
NSynth is a dataset developed by Google’s Magenta team that contains over 300,000 musical notes generated from various instruments. Each note is labeled with pitch, timbre, and velocity. It’s ideal for training AI models in sound synthesis, timbre transfer, and audio generation.
Spotify provides a powerful API that gives access to metadata about songs, artists, genres, and even audio features like tempo, energy, and danceability. It’s commonly used for training AI models in music recommendation systems, playlist generation, and mood-based classification.
